Hi Christopher, Christopher Bradford from the grading team here!

You've done a great job so far. There are a few refinements that will be necessary to get this one approved.

You'll need to include a favicon for your app; currently it's displaying the default React one.

You're styling is extremely simple and is not engaging. Take a moment to look at similar sites that you enjoy or where inspired by, and use the design guidelines to make your app more visually engaging.

Your readme's are OK, but could be better -- please read the following article about writing great readme's and take some inspiration to refine yours. https://medium.com/@meakaakka/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3

Great to see you have well written tests, and also clean code. Your app functions well and presents no errors in the console. Get those things above addressed and you'll be ready to go!
